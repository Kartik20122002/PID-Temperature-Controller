## Controlling Temperature using PID Controller

An air temperature controller is a device used to regulate the temperature of a specific space or system. It is commonly employed in heating, ventilation, air conditioning systems, and various industrial processes where temperature control is critical.

The basic function of an air temperature controller is to maintain a set temperature by controlling the operation of heating or cooling systems. When the temperature deviates from the desired setpoint, the controller activates the appropriate equipment to either increase or decrease the temperature until the setpoint is reached.

Modern air temperature controllers can be analog or digital and may offer advanced features such as programmable schedules, remote control capabilities, and integration with smart home or building automation systems. These controllers are widely used in residential, commercial, and industrial settings to ensure comfort, energy efficiency, and optimal performance of heating and cooling systems.
